# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualiser
An interactive pathfinding visualiser that demonstrates how algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path from start to goal. It compares multiple strategies like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS and more, highlighting their speed, efficiency, and decision-making in real time
